<br>
Project from the Odin Project curriculum

### Project Description
* Classic tic-tac-toe game
* Allows custom name for each player upon start of the game; defaults to "X" and "O" if no change is made.
* Message box above board controls flow of the game telling each user when it is their turn.
* Upon the end of a game, a message appears on the screen displaying the result of the match.
* Reset button hides the game board and outlines the player names to indicate you may change the name of the players.
* Start! button will submit the player names inputted and show the gameboard to begin the game.
* Restart button appears at the end of the game and it clears the board to allow a rematch.
    
### Project Reflection
* This was a good project for working with two dimensional arrays.
* I have learned about factory functions and modules and how they should be used instead of classes.
* I am getting even more comfortable with adding event listeners and DOM manipulation.
* I did not do much with the Player factory function, but that is because I spent much time on the gameBoard and displayController modules.
* I did not spend as much time on CSS as I usually do, but I am ok with the end result for now.
